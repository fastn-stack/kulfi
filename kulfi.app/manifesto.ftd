-- ds.heading-large: Kulfi Manifesto: Reclaim the Internet

We are building Kulfi Net: a sovereign, decentralized, peer-to-peer internet.

It’s not just another protocol—it’s a movement to re-architect the foundations
of how we build, access, and own our digital lives.

-- ds.heading-medium: 🌍 Why Kulfi?

The current internet is a web of intermediaries.

Your data flows through centralized corporations. Your applications depend on
cloud services. Your identity is rented, not owned.

We’ve traded sovereignty for convenience.

Kulfi Net breaks this trade-off.

We give you the tools to **run your own services, own your data, and connect
directly with others—securely and privately.**

Kulfi is not a patch on the existing web—it is a parallel, general-purpose
**peer-to-peer internet**, from the protocol up to the application layer.

-- ds.heading-medium: 🧩 What Makes Kulfi Different?

-- ds.heading-small: 🆔 Identity-First Networking

Kulfi replaces IP addresses with **ID52**: a DNSSEC-encoded public key.

This is your network identity—not just an address, but your cryptographic
fingerprint.

No more reliance on static IPs or NAT traversal hacks. No certificates to beg
for. You generate your ID, and you’re live.

-- ds.heading-small: 🌐 Kulfi Browser + fastn = App Sovereignty

We’re not just building a protocol—we’re building an experience.

-- ds.copy-regular:

- **Kulfi Browser**: A WebKit-based browser that supports both `kulfi://` and
  `https://` links.
- **Built-in `fastn` runtime**: fastn is a full-stack, Rust-based programming
  language and app platform, purpose-built to be easy to learn, lightweight,
  and powerful.
- You don’t just browse the web—you **host it**, peer-to-peer, from your phone
  or your Raspberry Pi.

-- ds.copy-regular:

No servers. No cloud. No middlemen.

-- ds.heading-medium: 📦 The Hardware Vision

We’re building **open source hardware modules**—tiny, low-power boards preloaded
with fastn and Kulfi Net, ready to drop into smart devices. Imagine:

-- ds.copy-regular:

- A refrigerator running a photo-sharing service hosted on itself.
- A security camera accessible only via ID52, from anywhere, with no vendor cloud.
- A personal chat server running on your bookshelf.

-- ds.copy-regular:

> We prototype with Raspberry Pi today. Tomorrow, it will be custom silicon
> embedded in every smart device you own.

This is **not IoT as usual**.

It’s not a new SaaS platform.

**This is your own cloud, without the cloud.**

-- ds.heading-medium: 🚀 Why You?

-- ds.copy-regular:

This is a call to the developers, engineers, tinkerers, and dreamers:

-- ds.copy-regular:

- If you’ve been frustrated with the complexity of modern full-stack web
  development—fastn is your escape hatch.
- If you’ve built or deployed peer-to-peer systems—Kulfi needs your insight.
- If you’re into hardware, open silicon, or OS-level plumbing—help us embed
  this vision into real-world devices.
- If you believe in privacy, freedom, and decentralization—not just as
  buzzwords, but as core engineering principles—you belong here.

-- ds.heading-medium: 🤝 Join Us

Kulfi is a public infrastructure project, built in the open. We’re looking for:

-- ds.copy-regular:

- Contributors to fastn, Kulfi Net, and Kulfi Browser
- Hardware enthusiasts to prototype and validate embedded modules
- Partner companies willing to pilot Kulfi in real-world devices
- Early adopters to build the first generation of peer-to-peer web apps

-- ds.copy-regular:

We’re not starting from scratch—we’re already building.

Join us on [GitHub](https://github.com/fastn-stack/kulfi) and
[fastn.com](https://fastn.com). Join our discussions. Build with us.

-- ds.heading-medium: 🌱 Let’s Rebuild the Internet—Together

The current internet served us well. But the future demands something better:

-- ds.copy-regular:

- Local-first, not cloud-first
- Identity-secure, not IP-exposed
- Human-scale, not hyperscale
- Open source, not black box
- Peer-to-peer, not permission-ed

-- ds.copy-regular:

**Kulfi Net is that future. Come build it with us.**
