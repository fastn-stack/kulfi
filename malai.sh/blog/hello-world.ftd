-- ds.heading-large: Announcing Malai!

-- ds.copy-regular:

[`malai`](https://github.com/fastn-stack/kulfi) is a new open-source tool
from the team at [FifthTry](https://fifthtry.com/team/). It helps you share
your local HTTP server with the world — instantly and securely.

Built on top of the powerful [iroh](https://iroh.computer) P2P stack, `malai`
lets you expose your local development environment without deploying it to a
public server or configuring firewalls and DNS.

Whether you're testing webhooks, giving someone a quick demo, or just want to
show off your side project, `malai` makes it dead simple.

-- ds.copy-regular:

Install `malai` today using:

-- ds.code:
lang: bash

curl -fsSL https://malai.sh/install.sh | sh

-- ds.copy-regular:

And run:

-- ds.code:
lang: bash

\$ malai http 3000 --public
Malai: Sharing http://127.0.0.1:3000 at
https://pubqaksutn9im0ncln2bki3i8diekh3sr4vp94o2cg1agjrb8dhg.kulfi.site
To avoid the public proxy, run your own with: malai http-bridge

Or use: malai browse kulfi://pubqaksutn9im0ncln2bki3i8diekh3sr4vp94o2cg1agjrb8dhg

-- ds.copy-regular:

This will share your local HTTP server running on `http://localhost:3000` with the
world via a secure, shareable URL.

You can also use `malai browse` subcommand to access this from another computer:

-- ds.code:
lang: bash

malai browse kulfi://<id52-from-the-above-output>

-- ds.copy-regular:

See the [Getting Started guide](/get-started/) or run `malai --help` to explore all the options.

-- ds.heading-medium: Use Cases

-- ds.copy-regular:

Here are just a few things you can do with `malai`:

- **User Acceptance Testing**
  Share your in-progress app with non-technical stakeholders without pushing to staging.

- **HTTPS Testing**
  Test HTTPS-only features like Service Workers and OAuth callbacks with a trusted remote URL.

- **Webhook Testing**
  Test Stripe, GitHub, or any other webhook provider locally, without deploying your backend.

- **Developer Preview**
  Send a URL to your teammate to get feedback on your frontend work before merging.

All this without any config, DNS setup, or cloud deploys.

-- ds.heading-medium: Bring your own HTTP bridge

-- ds.copy-regular:

Malai is designed with decentralization in mind. By default, Malai uses a free
public HTTP bridge hosted at `kulfi.site`. This means you can start sharing
your local server with the world right away — no setup required.

But if you'd prefer more control, privacy, or reliability, you can run your own
bridge. Malai makes it easy to self-host your own HTTP bridge, and you can
configure the CLI to use your custom bridge instead of the default one.

See the [Getting Started](/get-started/#run-your-own-bridge) guide for
step-by-step instructions on setting up your own bridge and pointing Malai to
it.

-- ds.heading-medium: What’s Next?

-- ds.copy-regular:

We're actively working on expanding what you can do with `malai`. Here’s a peek
at what’s coming:

- Share any **TCP server**, not just HTTP
  Soon you'll be able to share any TCP-based service running locally —
  including your Postgres database, Redis, or even a custom TCP protocol — using
  the same seamless workflow.

- Native support for **SSH** using `malai ssh`
  We're adding support for secure shell access over P2P with `malai ssh`. This
  will let you remotely access your development machine or share a shell session
  without needing public IPs or VPNs.

- Experimental support for sharing **local devices** like printers and storage
  over peer-to-peer. We're exploring ways to let you securely share physical
  hardware — like printers or external drives — directly from your machine over
  P2P, with fine-grained access controls.

In parallel, we're building a companion GUI app called **Kulfi**. Kulfi will
make it easy to browse and connect to shared services — no bridge required.
It'll also include built-in access control (ACL) management, so you can choose
exactly who gets access to what. Whether you’re sharing with teammates,
friends, or devices across your network, Kulfi will give you visibility and
control.

You can learn more about our plans for `kulfi` and `malai` on our [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/fastn-stack/kulfi/discussions) page.
