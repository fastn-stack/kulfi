-- string description:

Malai TCP can be used to share your local TCP server with anyone. This can be
your database server or SSH server. We also talk about how malai can be used to
directly serve a folder on your computer with everyone.

-- ds.heading-large: Introducing Malai TCP & A Bonus!

-- ds.copy-regular:

[`malai-0.2.5`](https://github.com/fastn-stack/kulfi/releases/) is out now!
It brings a new feature to share your local TCP server with the world!

Now you can share any TCP-based service running locally — including your
SSH service, Postgres database, Redis, or even a custom TCP protocol — using the
same seamless workflow that you used with `malai http`.

-- ds.copy-regular:

Install `malai` today using:

-- ds.code:
lang: bash

curl -fsSL https://malai.sh/install.sh | sh

-- ds.copy-regular:

And run:

-- ds.code:
lang: bash

\$ malai tcp 5432 --public
Malai: Sharing port 5432
Run malai tcp-bridge <id52> <some-port>
to connect to it from any machine.

-- ds.copy-regular:

This will share your local TCP server running on port 5432 with the world. You
can connect to it from any machine using the command:

-- ds.code:
lang: bash

\$ malai tcp-bridge <id52> 9091
Listening on 127.0.0.1:9091

-- ds.copy-regular:

Now you can connect to `localhost:9091` and it'll go through `malai` and
connect to the exposed service.

-- ds.heading-medium: Share your SSH server

You can even use `malai tcp` to expose your local SSH server for remote access — without opening port 22 publicly.

First, make sure the OpenSSH server is running:

-- ds.code:
lang: bash

systemctl status sshd

-- ds.copy-regular:

Then, run the following on the machine where the SSH server is running:

-- ds.code:
lang: bash

\$ malai tcp 22 --public
Malai: Sharing port 5432
Run malai tcp-bridge <id52> <some-port>
to connect to it from any machine.

-- ds.copy-regular:

On another machine, use the bridge command:

-- ds.code:
lang: bash

\$ malai tcp-bridge <id52> 9090

-- ds.copy-regular:

Replace `<id52>` with the ID printed by the `malai tcp` command. Once the
bridge is running, SSH into your machine like this:

-- ds.code:
lang: bash

ssh -p 9090 user@localhost

-- ds.copy-regular:

You're connecting to `localhost:9090`, which is where the `tcp-bridge` is
listening. It forwards your SSH traffic to the original machine via the Kulfi
network. Make sure to use the correct `user` that exists on the remote machine.

-- ds.heading-medium: Use cases

- Secure your SSH server behind the Kulfi network.
- Share a local Postgres or Redis instance with your team.
- Demo a multiplayer game server or custom TCP service.
- Students can share networked apps or environments with instructors for
  real-time help or grading.

To learn more about `malai tcp`, check out the [documentation](/tcp/).

-- ds.heading-medium: Wait, we have more!

We've also added a new `malai folder` command to share a folder with everyone.
This is similar to `malai http` but it serves your local files and folders.
This is more like a call for testing than launching a new feature. Try it out
and give us feedback!

-- ds.code: `malai folder` Example
lang: bash

\$ malai folder ~/projects/fastn/assets/ --public
Serving "/Users/siddhant/projects/fastn/assets" on http://127.0.0.1:59136
Malai: Sharing http://127.0.0.1:59136 at
https://pubqaksutn9im0ncln2bki3i8diekh3sr4vp94o2cg1agjrb8dhg.kulfi.site
To avoid the public proxy, run your own with: malai http-bridge

Or use: malai browse kulfi://pubqaksutn9im0ncln2bki3i8diekh3sr4vp94o2cg1agjrb8dhg

-- ds.copy-regular:

This spins up a basic HTTP server behind the scenes to serve the provided folder:
